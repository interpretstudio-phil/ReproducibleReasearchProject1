This document was produced using R Markdown and the original notebook can be found in [Github](https://github.com/interpretstudio-phil/ReproducibleReasearchProject1)   

**Loading and preprocessing the data**  
Load the data downloaded from public online data source [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) and
transform the datatypes for analysis, specifically the date and increment to a 
date and datetime type 
```{r load packages,message=FALSE}
library('tidyverse')
library('lubridate')
library('ggplot2')
```

```{r load and transform data}
act <- read.csv('Activity.csv')
act <- mutate(act, date=dmy(date))
str(act)
summary(act)
```

**What is mean total number of steps taken per day?**  
```{r mean, fig.width=10}
# remove NA's, group by each day and summarise the total steps
daily.act <- act %>% 
        filter(!is.na(steps)) %>% 
        group_by(date) %>% 
        summarise(steps=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE))

# Steps by day
print(daily.act)

# histogram of daily steps with 15 bins 
hist(daily.act$steps, breaks=15, xlab = 'Daily Steps', main = 'Daily Steps Histogram')

# display the mean and median daily steps
summary(daily.act$steps)

```
**What is the average daily activity pattern?**
```{r pattern, fig.width=10}
# Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average 
# number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
# remove NA's, group by each day and summarise the total steps
intdaily.act <- act %>% 
        filter(!is.na(steps)) %>% 
        group_by(interval) %>% 
        summarise(steps=mean(steps))

#plot time series 
with(intdaily.act, plot(interval, steps, type='l', ylab='average steps'))

#determine which 5-min interval has the greatest average/mean
intdaily.act[which.max(intdaily.act$steps),]

```
**Imputing missing values**
```{r imputing values for NA, fig.width=10,message=FALSE}
# show summary stats including count of missing/NA observations
summary(act$steps)

# for the NA observations replace with the rounded mean value for that interval
na.act <- act %>% 
        filter(is.na(steps)) %>% 
        select(date,interval) %>%
        left_join(intdaily.act) %>%
        mutate(steps=round(steps),date, interval)

imputed.act <- bind_rows(na.act,filter(act,!is.na(steps)))
intimputeddaily.act <- imputed.act %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(steps=mean(steps))

# plot the average steps for each interval  across the days with imputed values 
with(intimputeddaily.act, plot(interval, steps, type='l', ylab='average steps (incl imputed)'))

# display the mean and median daily steps
summary(intimputeddaily.act$steps)

```
**Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?**
```{r compare weekday & weekend, fig.width=10,message=FALSE}
# add a computed variable factor with two levels weekday and weekend
daytype.act <- mutate(imputed.act, daytype=factor(ifelse(wday(date)>5,'weekend','weekday')))

# summarise by day type and interval and average the steps
intdaytype.act <- daytype.act %>% 
        group_by(interval, daytype) %>% 
        summarise(steps=mean(steps))

g <- ggplot(intdaytype.act,aes(interval,steps)) + geom_line() 
g <- g + facet_grid(rows = vars(daytype)) + 
  labs(y='average steps (incl imputed)', title='average steps for each interval')
print(g)
```
